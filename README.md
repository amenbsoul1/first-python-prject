The program is solving some questions given in an assessment. It includes different problems in different parts.

## Part 1:

##### Question 1a: The program takes three integers as input and checks whether they form a Pythagorean triplet or not. If they form a Pythagorean triplet, the program prints 'yes', otherwise, it prints 'no'.
##### Question 1b: The program takes an integer n as input and checks all possible Pythagorean triplets where a, b, and c are integers between 1 and n (inclusive). If any triplet is found, the program prints the triplet.
##### Question 1c: The program takes two integers a and b as input and checks if they form a Pythagorean triplet or not. If they form a Pythagorean triplet, the program prints 'yes', otherwise, it prints 'no'.
## Part 2:

##### Question 2a: The program takes three integers a0, n, and d as input. It computes the product of all numbers greater than a0 and divisible by d up to n. If there are no such numbers, the program prints 1.
##### Question 2b: The program takes two integers n and m as input. It computes the product of all possible values of (a, b, c), where a, b, and c are integers between 1 and n (inclusive), such that a^2 + b^2 is divisible by m.
##### Question 2c: The program takes two integers n and m as input. It computes the product of all prime factors of n, where the exponent of each factor is divisible by m.
## Part 3:

##### Question 3: The program takes two integers a and b as input. It checks whether b is a multiple of a or not. If b is a multiple of a, the program checks whether a and b have any common divisors other than 1. If they have, it prints 'False', otherwise, it prints 'True'.
## Part 4:

##### Question 4a: The program takes a string and an integer d as input. It removes the character at position d in the string and prints the new string.
##### Question 4b: The program takes three strings s1, s2, and s3 as input. It removes all characters in s1 that occur in s2 and are surrounded by characters from s3. It then prints the new string.
##### Question 4c: The program takes a sentence as input. It replaces all vowels in the sentence with '*'. It then counts the number of words in the sentence and creates a new sentence where each word is numbered.
